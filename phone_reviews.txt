["\nI am enjoying 5g access for first time.This device is entry level by amazon and redmi collabration.I bought this for less than 8k with my old redmi 9a  exchange offer.Phone specs  for 4gb ram - I have good OTT apps and screen is good.Usage of 1.7Gb ram by OS is too much though.I hope upcoming updates fix this.Lock screen is finger print -Its good upgrade for me.Experience using other launcher and keypads - I use nova launcher and microsoft swift keypad- gesture control is blocked when you opt for third party launchers - keyboard looks perfect with big screen.There is 3 button at bottom which you cant remove.Bloatware is plenty - I didn't sign in google account immediately - I uninstall most apps.I feel battery drain with my 5g usage ,But yeah great  hotspot for my laptop or tablet.Gaming :Not much into gaming - I play crosswords , spelling games- hardly any issue when playing . This phone is not for graphic intensive games. But Okay for subway surfer , temple run games kind of games .Issues :I am waiting for UI updates to fix landscape screen crashing. And Also Google play doesn't load up sometimes- need to reset or clear cache .Charging takes 2hrs nearly- I end up charging twice a day.Speaker felt weird for few days- then I got adapted  to it.I have mic issues  when taking call in speaker mode.Final verdict :If  looking for basic phone with 5g processor - UI needs bug fixes though - buy it if you know what you are signing up.\n", "\nI like quite a lot about this phone.

The hardware specs are neat.So far, I haven't had a good time with the camera. The pictures often come out blurry, which means that autofocus isn't very quick. Redmi's older note phones have better cameras.My biggest disappointment with this phone is the UI. MIUI is a terrible OS if you're into customization and other things. Firstly, don't expect a lot of features that were offered. Xiaomi locks many of the MIUI features for China only, but also locks them out of lower-end devices like this. Secondly, they have disabled full-screen gestures if you're using a custom launcher. The default MIUI launcher is terrible as well and just doesn't look good. For an individual who is accustomed to the stock Android experience, the MIUI 14 has been a dismal experience after almost 20 days of using the phone.I really want to give the phone a higher rating, but the software is preventing me from doing so.
